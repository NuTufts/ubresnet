# Models

Folder for models in use or underdevelopment. Most code in pytorch. In the future, also will support TensorFlow versions.

Ask someone for trained model weights.  Will post somewhere public at some point.

## In Use

* `UResNet` in `ub_uresnet.py`. UNet with ResNet blocks. Upsampling done using Conv2d transpose layers. Simiar to model used by MicroBooNE SSNet 2018 paper.
* [need translated SSNet 2017 paper model here]

## In Development
